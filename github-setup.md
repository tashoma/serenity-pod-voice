# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

This document provides instructions for setting up the SerenityPod Voice GitHub repository.

## Creating the Repository

1. Create a new GitHub repository named "serenity-pod-voice"
2. Make it public or private based on your preference
3. Initialize with a README.md file
4. Add a .gitignore file for Node.js projects
5. Choose an appropriate license (e.g., MIT)

## Pushing the Code

```bash
# Initialize git in the project directory (if not already initialized)
git init

# Add the remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/serenity-pod-voice.git

# Add all files to staging
git add .

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Initial commit: SerenityPod Voice MVP"

# Push to the main branch
git push -u origin main
```

## Repository Structure

Ensure the repository includes:

- Source code in the src/ directory
- Public assets in the public/ directory
- Configuration files (.env.example, package.json, etc.)
- Documentation (README.md, LICENSE)

## Branches

Consider creating the following branches:

- `main`: Production-ready code
- `development`: Active development branch
- `feature/voice-integration`: For voice-related features
- `feature/mood-detection`: For mood detection features
- `feature/avatar-animation`: For avatar animation features

## Collaborator Settings

If working with a team:

1. Go to Settings > Collaborators
2. Add collaborators using their GitHub usernames or email addresses
3. Set appropriate permissions (read, write, admin)

## GitHub Pages (Optional)

To set up GitHub Pages for a demo:

1. Go to Settings > Pages
2. Select the branch to deploy (e.g., main or gh-pages)
3. Choose the /docs folder or /root as the source
4. Save the settings

## GitHub Actions (Optional)

Consider setting up GitHub Actions for:

- Continuous Integration (CI)
- Automated testing
- Deployment to hosting services
- Dependency updates

## Security Considerations

- Set up branch protection rules
- Configure dependabot for security updates
- Do not commit .env files with actual API keys
- Use secrets for sensitive information in GitHub Actions
